# TODO

- Time the experiment run time:
  - Gradient-based approach:
    - Full algorithm run
  - ML approach:
    - Sample generation 
    - Parameter tuning and training time
    - Subsequent optimization step

- Save additional data:
  - ML approach:
    - Subsequent optimization step objective function value history
